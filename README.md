# A1181-Macbook-mint
Getting Linux Mint to work on an a1181 MacBook 2,1
This is a project I started in my free time so if it's a little unpolished my apologies.
The first step I recommend if you haven't done it already is to disassemble the system and do some routine maintenance and install of an SSD.
These systems are nearing twenty years old as of writing so some new thermal paste and a cleaning of the fans is appreciated. Guides can be found on the Ifixit website. 
For the actual Linux install, I used https://mattgadient.com/linux-dvd-images-and-how-to-for-32-bit-efi-macs-late-2006-models/
to procure an install ISO. I used the Mint 22 XFCE. I then burned the ISO using ImgBurn onto an external dvd.
